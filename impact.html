       <p>The absence of a gate on the left front side of the court causes significant amount of time loss during gameplay.The game flow is interrupted leading to the players avoiding to play strong shots on the left side.
        As documented, the lost time varies from minimum 1 minute to maximum 7 minutes in a time slot of just 30 minutes!This situation can slow down the rythm of the game adversely. In volleyball, momentum and pace are significant factors and interruptions of 2-3 minutes every time the ball goes out will break the momentum of the game and reduce intensity.Volleyball is fast-paced, and pauses can cool muscles down, increasing the risk of minor strains when play resumes.
