  <h2>PROBLEM STATEMENT</h2>
  <p>
    Players are bothered by the inaccess to the left of the court as whenever the ball is thrown out, it breaks the momentum of the game. Since there is a gate in the right side of the court, usually players on the right side would have to retrieve the ball.This causes fatigue and breaks the rhythm of the players. 5-7 minutes mean nothing to us, but to the players, they are crucial, specially in a fast paced game such as Volleyball.These kinds of interruptions also make the game unserious as the players loose their flow, they get distracted.This breaks concentration and reduced motivation to continue.
  </p> 

<p>  Interruptions reduce team bonding and cordination which would have built through the game.Casual players may stop coming.</p>
